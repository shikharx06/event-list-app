# react event booking app using graphql

the live website can be found here: https://sinewolfeventapp.herokuapp.com/

- you can login using username: example@user.com and password: 12345  or sign up with new credentials.
- **note**: it might take some time to load the website because heroku server shuts it down after 30 min of inactivity
- it has authorization (login and signup), event creation, view, and booking system.

BUGS:

- i didn't have time to validate the user signing in so if incorrect details are entered, it won't do anything.
